# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning

This repository contains a comprehensive data mining project focused on predicting bike rental demand using various machine learning techniques. The project explores the **Bike Sharing Dataset** and applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and several regression models to accurately forecast hourly bike rental counts.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
  Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature transformation for improved model performance.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Visualization of trends, seasonality, and key factors affecting bike rentals (hour, weather, season, working day, etc.).

- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  Implementation and comparison of multiple regression algorithms including:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Linear Regression

- **Model Evaluation:**  
  Performance comparison using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and MAPE, with results presented in clear tables and plots.

- **Cross-validation:**  
  10-fold cross-validation applied to ensure reliable model selection and prevent overfitting.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering
- **EDA:** Statistical summaries and visualizations (bar plots, scatter plots, boxplots, etc.)
- **Modeling:** Training, evaluation, and comparison of multiple ML models
- **Conclusion:** Final model selection and discussion of results
